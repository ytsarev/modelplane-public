"""Routing: front a replica's engine workloads with a serving surface.

The workload backends (native, llm-d, dynamo) compose engines only; this layer
decorates them with the routing the replica's serving.mode selects. apply picks
the strategy:

- Unified fronts the serving pods with a GAIE InferencePool + endpoint picker,
  so requests route by prefix cache and load rather than round-robin. One path
  whether the replica serves from a single pod or many: the picker is vestigial
  for one pod, but the alternative is swapping a Service + HTTPRoute for a pool
  the moment a second pod appears, which would drop in-flight requests.
- PrefillDecode (disaggregated) role-labels the two phase engines, injects the
  pd-sidecar on decode, and fronts both with a GAIE InferencePool + endpoint
  picker, routed to in place of a Service.

The backends build no routing of their own, so a strategy only adds resources
(and, for disaggregated, decorates the decode pod) - nothing is removed.

Engine flags, including --kv-transfer-config for the NixlConnector, are the
user's; this layer injects none.

# there (KV then flows prefill->decode over NIXL). The selective
# prefix-based-pd-decider disaggregates only when a request's uncached suffix is
# at least nonCachedTokens long, so short or cache-hot prompts skip the prefill
# hop (and its KV-transfer cost) and serve decode-only.
#
# Three things must line up or it silently never disaggregates, and the EPP
# image we run (llm-d-inference-scheduler v0.8.0, embedding
# gateway-api-inference-extension v1.5.0) makes the defaults wrong on every one:
#   1. nonCachedTokens defaults to 0, which the decider treats as "disabled"
#      (always decode-only). Set it explicitly.
#   2. The decider reads a PrefixCacheMatchInfo attribute that prefix-cache-scorer
#      no longer produces (GIE v1.5.0 split production into a separate plugin and
#      made prepare-data default-on, so the old `prepareDataPlugins` feature gate
#      the v0.8.0 docs still mention is *unregistered* and crashes the EPP). The
#      producer is now an explicit plugin: approx-prefix-cache-producer.
#   3. That producer defaults to autoTune: true, which leaves its block size 0
#      and never populates the attribute. Pin autoTune: false + blockSizeTokens.
# (Verified live: with this config the prefill engine's request_prefill_time
# counter increments for long prompts and stays flat for short ones; with the
# defaults it stayed at zero for everything.)
#
# blockSizeTokens MUST match the engine's KV block size or prefix-cache routing
# silently degrades (#179). It's derived best-effort from the engine flags via
# _kv_block_size() (BLOCK_SIZE_TOKENS placeholder), defaulting to vLLM's 16.
