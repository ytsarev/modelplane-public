"""Compose an EKS cluster with networking, node groups, and IAM roles.

This function provisions the AWS infrastructure for an inference environment:
a VPC with one subnet per AZ, an EKS cluster with system and GPU node groups,
IAM roles for the control plane and nodes, and ProviderConfigs for
provider-kubernetes and provider-helm to reach the cluster.

The kubeconfig written by the EKS ClusterAuth managed resource contains a
static bearer token that the AWS provider refreshes every refreshPeriod
(default 10 minutes) using its own ProviderConfig credentials. The AWS
principal that creates the cluster is granted cluster-admin via
bootstrapClusterCreatorAdminPermissions, so the same credentials are
authorised on the cluster. Downstream consumers only need the kubeconfig;
no per-cluster AWS identity has to be wired into provider-kubernetes.

        bandwidth: card 0 is interfaceType efa (EFA-with-ENA, the primary that
        also carries IP traffic), cards 1..N are efa-only (dedicated RDMA, no
        IP, which nodeadm leaves unmanaged). Card 0 takes device index 0, the
        rest device index 1 on their own network card. No interface requests a
        public IP - EKS rejects associate_public_ip_address with multiple
        interfaces, and the nodes are in private subnets reaching the internet
        through the NAT gateway.

        Every interface carries both the EFA security group (for the
        self-referencing all-traffic rules EFA OS-bypass needs) and the cluster
        security group (for node <-> control plane traffic). Defining
        networkInterfaces makes these authoritative; EKS no longer attaches the
        cluster security group itself, so a missing cluster SG leaves the node
        unable to reach the API server.

        Both groups are set as raw IDs in securityGroups, not as
        securityGroupRefs. The provider resolves securityGroupRefs into the same
        securityGroups field, but its multi-reference resolver is a no-op once
        that field is already populated (it caches resolved values). Mixing a
        ref for the EFA group with a literal cluster-group ID would make the
        resolver skip the ref, dropping the EFA group from every interface the
        moment the cluster reports its SG. So we resolve the EFA group's own ID
        ourselves from its observed external name and set both as literals. Both
        IDs are absent on the first reconcile (the EFA SG isn't created and the
        cluster hasn't reported its SG yet); securityGroups stays unset until
        each lands, so the template gains them over the next reconciles.
